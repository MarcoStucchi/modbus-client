# modbus-client
Modbus client based on pymodbus library. 

## Scope of the project 

The aim of this project are multiple: 
* Familiarize with the Python language
* Design a generic Modbus TCP client. To get there, however, a device-specific implementation is the first step. This client connects to a Huawei Converter I'm using as a gateway towards a Power Line Communication bus.
